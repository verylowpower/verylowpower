Hello I'm Duong

Passionate about 2D and 3D game development with Unity and C#.  

Experienced in gameplay, AI, and pixel art using Aseprite.

ðŸ”¹ Project: [Mirror â€“ 2D Survivor-like Game](https://github.com/verylowpower/Mirror)  (In Development)

Implemented spatial partitioning system to manage enemy spawning and AI updates efficiently.

Level up by collecting buffs and transform into a more powerful version.
